## **1. Software methods for healthy aging or Alzheimer’s disease**
Mentions the use and evaluation of convolutional neural networks and open-source frameworks for classification of Alzheimer’s disease from brain imaging data.

### [**1.1 Machine learning and statistical methods for imaging genetics and multi-omics association studies**](/docs/PennAITech_LLM/4.1_Software_ML-Stat_ImagingGenetics)
Computational approaches for associating genetic, genomic, transcriptomic, epigenetic, and multi-omics data with neuroimaging phenotypes, disease risk, and progression, including GWAS, multi-task learning, Bayesian models, and network-based methods.

### [**1.2 Machine learning and statistical methods for single-cell and spatial omics analysis**](/docs/PennAITech_LLM/4.2_Software_ML-Stat_SingleCell)
Computational tools for analyzing single-cell RNA-seq, spatial transcriptomics, and related omics data to identify cell types, disease genes, regulatory networks, and biomarkers related to aging and Alzheimer’s disease.

### [**1.3 Machine learning methods for genetic variant analysis and annotation**](/docs/PennAITech_LLM/4.3_Software_ML-Stat_GeneticVariant)
Software and algorithms for variant calling, annotation, fine-mapping, and functional interpretation of genetic variants associated with aging and Alzheimer’s disease.

### [**1.4 Machine learning methods for biomarker discovery and disease subtype identification**](/docs/PennAITech_LLM/4.4_Software_ML-Stat_BiomarkerDiscovery)
Approaches for identifying imaging, genetic, molecular, or cellular biomarkers, as well as disease subtypes and heterogeneity, using clustering, feature selection, and multi-modal data integration.
