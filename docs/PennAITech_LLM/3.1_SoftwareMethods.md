## **1. Software methods for healthy aging or Alzheimer’s disease**
Mentions the use and evaluation of convolutional neural networks and open-source frameworks for classification of Alzheimer’s disease from brain imaging data.

### **1.1 Machine learning and statistical methods for imaging genetics and multi-omics association studies**
Computational approaches for associating genetic, genomic, transcriptomic, epigenetic, and multi-omics data with neuroimaging phenotypes, disease risk, and progression, including GWAS, multi-task learning, Bayesian models, and network-based methods.

### **1.2 Machine learning and statistical methods for single-cell and spatial omics analysis**
Computational tools for analyzing single-cell RNA-seq, spatial transcriptomics, and related omics data to identify cell types, disease genes, regulatory networks, and biomarkers related to aging and Alzheimer’s disease.

### **1.3 Machine learning methods for genetic variant analysis and annotation**
Software and algorithms for variant calling, annotation, fine-mapping, and functional interpretation of genetic variants associated with aging and Alzheimer’s disease.

### **1.4 Machine learning methods for biomarker discovery and disease subtype identification**
Approaches for identifying imaging, genetic, molecular, or cellular biomarkers, as well as disease subtypes and heterogeneity, using clustering, feature selection, and multi-modal data integration.

### **1.5 Methods for longitudinal and progression modeling**
Methods for modeling disease progression, aging trajectories, and longitudinal changes in neuroimaging, clinical, or omics data, including time-aware neural networks, longitudinal regression, and trajectory synthesis.

### **1.6 Methods for preprocessing, harmonization, and quality control**
Tools and algorithms for preprocessing, harmonizing, denoising, segmenting, and quality controlling neuroimaging and omics data, including cross-site harmonization and batch-effect correction.

### **1.7 Machine learning methods for drug discovery and repositioning**
Computational approaches for *in silico* drug repurposing and discovery using network-based and deep learning methods in the context of aging and Alzheimer’s disease.
